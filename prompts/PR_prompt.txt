## Description

This PR introduces the webhook for the clamAv malware scanning.

## Key Changes

1. **New Secured Endpoint**
   - Adds a new `/ingress/hooks/malware-scanner` webhook endpoint that receives scan results from an external malware scanning service.
   - The endpoint is publicly accessible but secured with signature validation to ensure only authorized scanners can send results.
2. **File Scanning & Results**
   - Files can now be flagged as `CLEAN`, `MALICIOUS`, or `NOT_SCANNED` based on scan results.
   - Scan details (like scanner type, timestamp, and threat status) are stored with each file.
   - Handles both individual files and batches of uploaded files (upload bundles).
3. **Smart Status Tracking**
   - For files with multiple scans (e.g., thumbnails, original, script), the system automatically determines the overall threat level by prioritizing the most severe result.
   - Prevents duplicate scan results from being recorded.
4. **Flexible Integration**
   - Works with existing file upload flows (both single files and bulk uploads).
   - Includes comprehensive tests to verify scanning behavior for different file types and threat scenarios.
